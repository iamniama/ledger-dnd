# ledger-dnd
Born in a dimly lit study, Ledger never expected to be anything but a basic, natural language dice roller with a snazzy name (Gnomish Dice Cup), until its Author began watching D&amp;D stream videos to pass the time.  Overcome with nostalgia, the Author set Ledger on its quest to become a full featured session management tool that allows DMs and players to make any roll they need to, with all relevant modifiers applied (even that item from last year that you forgot you had!), while also managing individual and party inventory, character progression and abilities, and ideally anything else that needs dice or paper at the table.
